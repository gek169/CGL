On windows, OpenGL, GLU, and OpenAL are named differently.
Linux:
-lGL -lGLU -lopenal
Windows:
-lopengl32 -lglu32 -lopenal32

The makefile has been altered to accomodate these changes, but
if the makefile can't detect you're on windows with $(OS) then
you may have to implement these changes manually.
